# Introduction 
This is our networking project. This was made in our third semester.
The project had a few requierments the biggest ones were:
- It had to use REST
- It had to use either TCP or URP

Further more we wanted to put networking abilites to the test and create a Central Server that handles all clients
Then at run time create Jeopardy game servers when they were needed and close the servers when they were not needed anymore.
These Game Servers were made to be as modular and scaleable as possible. 

Our thoughts behind this was that we wanted to be able to increase the amount of players in the server 
and also have the ability to create other games than Jeopardy and simple plug and play it into the game servers.

We had a bit less than 2 weeks (since we also needed to make a report for the project) to make this which is why we ended up making it a console game. 

This is fully written in C# without use of any external frameworks.

(This is only setup to work locally! We did test it online with a Virtual Machine which worked just fine too)
